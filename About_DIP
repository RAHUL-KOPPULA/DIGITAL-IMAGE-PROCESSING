Image acquisition: This involves capturing an image using a digital camera or scanner, or importing an existing image into a computer.
Image enhancement: This involves improving the visual quality of an image, such as increasing contrast, reducing noise, and removing artifacts.
Image restoration: This involves removing degradation from an image, such as blurring, noise, and distortion.
Image segmentation: This involves dividing an image into regions or segments, each of which corresponds to a specific object or feature in the image.
Image representation and description: This involves representing an image in a way that can be analyzed and manipulated by a computer, and describing the features of an image in a compact and meaningful way.
Image analysis: This involves using algorithms and mathematical models to extract information from an image, such as recognizing objects, detecting patterns, and quantifying features.
Image synthesis and compression: This involves generating new images or compressing existing images to reduce storage and transmission requirements.
Digital image processing is widely used in a variety of applications, including medical imaging, remote sensing, computer vision, and multimedia.
